To run this program, you will need to first install Processing from processing.org's website (https://processing.org/download). 
After this, locate core.jar in the Processing's and link it to your install of this project.
Finally, click run.
The reason I did this, despite the fact that you have to install Processing anyway, is because it makes breaking the code up into packages much easier.
